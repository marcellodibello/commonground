# Topic

This seminar examines the idea of the common ground as a condition for meaningful disagreement, valid reasoning, rational inquiry about matters of fact, and political decision-making. The motivation for thinking about the common ground stems from the growing [political polarization](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/the-partisan-divide-on-political-values-grows-even-wider/) on issues such as climate change, immigration, vaccines, abortion, race, the #metoo movement, the nature of the American project, and more. The list is quite long. This polarization exists along with deep divisions along several lines: income and wealth, education, health, geography, lived experiences, etc. Seeking a common ground is often touted as the solution to the problem of polarization, and the lack of a common ground  as the cause. But what is a common ground, in the first place? Is seeking one the solution to polarization? If so, what kind of common ground should we be seeking? Is a common ground even possible or does it necessarily lead to the exclusion of some people?   As is often the case in philosophy, this course will not offer definitive answers, but rather, a framework of analysis.

<!---
This course examines works by authors not usually read together, drawing from classical texts in the history of philosophy (Aristotle, Locke, Leopardi), philosophy of language (David Lewis, Bob Stalnaker, Donald Davidson), epistemology (Jennifer Lakey, David Christensen, Thomas Kelly), political philosophy (John Rawls, Charles Mills, Elizabeth Anderson) and postcolonial theory (Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gaytri Spivak). 
--->

# Objectives

This course is meant for advanced undergraduates and graduates students. 
You will become familiar with different conceptions of the common ground 
in various sub-disciplines of philosophy. The goal is to 
understand these conceptions and utilize them to illuminate trends in 
society and politics today. You will sharpen your critical thinking skills, in reading  and  writing, for the analysis of theoretical concepts and their application to current 
social and political questions. You will read academic papers in different sub-disciplines of philosophy---philosophy of language, logic, epistemology, moral, social and political philosophy, post-colonial theory---and develop an appreciation for their distinctive contribution. 

# Course Materials

Readings and other course materials are available 
on this website. For readings covered 
by copyright, please check the Canvas page for this course.  
Course materials are divided into "essential" and "additional". 
You are only expected to study the essential ones, but I 
recommend that you have a look at the 
additional materials for at least one 
or two weeks.


# Requirements


## Participation

Please attend class regularly and participate 
(**10% of our grade**). This is a "seminar style" course. You are 
expected to take an active role in the discussions. Please study the assigned 
materials **before class** and be ready to discuss them. 


## Assignments

In addition, 
you should write ten 
Pass/Fail précis as well as three graded essays or 
a research paper (**90% of your grade**).

### Pass/fail 

Every week please write a **one-page précis** of one of the papers assigned for that week. 
The précis should describe: (a) topic of the paper; 
(b) main thesis (or main theses, if there are more than one); 
(c) supporting arguments; (d) objections to these arguments, complications or 
difficulties that the author considers (if any). Submit 
your précis each week through Canvas **before the beginning of class**. 
You should receive a PASS in **at least ten précis**, or else a full letter grade 
will be subtracted from your final grade: A would become B; B would become C; etc.


### Essays 

There will be three main graded assignments 
for this course, **5 pages each**. 

**1**. Write a **critical response** to one of the philosophy papers you read. 
Your response should contain a careful summary of the the specific thesis and argument of the paper you want to criticize (1-2 pages). After that, you should explain, in great detail and with painstaking precision, why you disagree with the paper's thesis and argument (3-4 pages). Please select a paper you disagree with. If you agree with everything you read, please come talk to me.


**2**. After doing independent research, collect and summarize a **case study** that illustrates the idea of the common ground (or lack thereof). The first part of your essay (1-2 pages) should describe your case study. Topics for your case study could include, but are not limited to, debates about abortion, vaccine, race, climate change. The second part (3-4 pages) should use some of the course readings to analyze your case study from the point of view of philosophy of language, logic or epistemology. 

**3**. Write a **philosophical argumentative essay** that attempts to answer the question "What Is the Common Ground and Why Does it Matter?" In answering the first part of the question, I recommend that you focus on a specific notion of the common ground, as is discussed in philosophy of language, logic, epistemology, social and political philosophy, or post-colonial theory. In answering the second part of the question, I recommend that you draw from current trends in society and politics. You may (but need not to) build on the case study you discussed in your second graded assignment. Keep in mind that in answering that second part of the question ("Why Does it Matter?"), you may argue that the common plays a positive role, a negative role, or some combination or the two.  You are encouraged to think critically about the common ground. 


### Research paper 

If you are a grad student or advanced undergrad with research experience, 
you may combine the three 5 page essays into one 
**15-20 page** research paper. The research paper should engage closely 
with a subset of the course materials including the additional ones. 
It is neither necessary nor recommended that you use materials outside those already 
included in the course materials. 

*Please come talk to me before you start working on the research paper.*

## Wk 1 - 1/12

**Introduction**

The need for a common ground can manifest itself in different areas of human engagement. In this course, we focus on four in particular: communication, reasoning, rational inquiry about the world, and political deliberation. These four areas fall (roughly) within the purview of four sub-disciplines of philosophy: philosophy of language; logic and argumentation theory;  epistemology and philosophy of science; and finally, value theory, including moral, social and political philosophy. To these four, we will add a fifth area of investigation, what we might call the question of inclusion and belonging. To address this question, we will sometimes reach beyond the boundaries of contemporary analytic philosophy and read works in post-colonial theory. 



## Wk 2 - 1/19


The first perspective on the common ground---and perhaps the most basic---is that the common ground is what allows us to communicate meaningfully with one another. In this sense, it comprises rules of communication, the meanings of words, and shared beliefs. 
But the common ground can also be what allows and makes possible more divisive forms of communication, such as hate speech. In this sense, the common ground 
is shared by a select group of people, but not everybody. This raises the question, whose common ground are we talking about? Does it even make sense to talk about a common ground that is shared by all?

## Wk 3 - 1/26


**Radical Interpretation**

What would happen if your interlocutor spoke a radically different 
language so that you could not understand what they say? This is the problem of radical interpretation. To carry out a translation, one needs to figure out what the other person means, and in order to figure out what the other person means, one needs to figure out what they believe. Without a grasp of what they mean or believe, no translation seems possible. To avoid this impasse, the principle of charity might help, that is, to assume that what we believe is what others would believe in similar circumstances. This assumed similarity of beliefs can then be used to carry out the translation. If this is right, the challenge of radical interpretation might not be too radical in the end. We share more with others than we might have thought.

## Wk 4  - 2/2


**Language Incommensurabiility**

In grappling with the problem of radical interpretation, we did not take seriously 
the possibility that other people who do not speak the same language as our own could hold radically different conceptions of the world. They could carve out the world, so to speak, in radically different ways from us. If that is so, how could we assume---as the principle of charity suggests---that we all share the same beliefs? The absence of a common ground, from a linguistic and conceptual perspective, is what is sometimes called incommensurability. 

There are many forms of incommensurability: one's language can be incommensurable relative to another, that, is, it is impossible to carry out a meaning-preserving translation from one language to another; one's system of concepts can be incommensurable to another; one's system of values and morals can be incommensurable to another; etc. We will focus primarily on linguistic and conceptual incommensurability and on arguments to the effect that the idea of incommensurability is actually untenable.

## Wk 5 - 2/9

**Logic and Argumentation**

The second perspective on the common ground we will examine 
has to do with logic, reasoning and argumentation. It would seem that, in virtue of sharing certain principles of reasoning, we can debate, disagree and resolve our disagreements. The scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages used to say "contra impugnantes principia non est disputandum (which can be translated as "against those who reject the principles of logic, there cannot be a discussion"). Here, the common ground comprises certain fundamental logical principles and rules of rational discussion. Such common ground makes rational discussion possible.  

And yet, it is surprising hard to justify even the most basic logical principle of all, the principle of non-contradiction---that one should not assert p and its negation at the same time. And, more recently, some logicians have even come to endorse logical pluralism, the view that in fact there can be a multiplicity of logical principles. If logical pluralism is correct, the validity of a piece of reasoning will vary on a case-by-case basis.  Perhaps, then, we should not aim to find a common ground by attempting to justify logical principles from scratch---that is very hard to do. Turning from logic to argumentation theory, a more more modest approach for finding a common ground is to agree on argumentative rules about rational inquiry as the conditions that make this inquiry possible.

## Wk 6 - 2/16


**Skepticism, Tradition and Common-sense**

We now turn from logic and argumentation theory to epistemology. Broadly speaking, we  all agree that as we aim to figure out facts about the world, we should gather pertinent evidence, conscientiously assess it and draw conclusions from it. 
So, the common ground, from an epistemological perspective, seems to be that we should be responsive to evidence if we aim to figure out what the world is like. But what does it mean to be 'responsive to evidence'? And why should be we responsive to evidence in the first place?

Being responsive to evidence will likely include a set of epistemic rules of and practices, such as follow the deliverance of the senses; perform experiments in such-and-such a way; and so.  The problem, however, is that whatever these epistemic rules and practices are, it would be hard to justify them in a non-circular way. This is the skeptical challenge. We might insist that common epistemic rules and practices are truth conducive. But how can we argue that being evidence-responsive is truth-condusive without, in a circular manner, appeal to evidence? And this challenge is not only theoretical. Scientists have suggested that "most published research is false"---that common rules and practices used to gather, analyze and  draw inference from evidence leads to falsehoods rather than truths. 

Instead of attempting to ground our epistemology from first principles, the common ground could include a reference to common-sense and traditions rooted in history. But this would seem a capitulation of reason and would still leave open the question, why should we follow common-sense or tradition in the first place?  Why should that be our common ground? The skeptical challenge persists.

## Wk 7 - 2/23


**Rational Polarization**


It is instructive to ask whether skepticism might be responsible for belief polarization about matters such as climate change or vaccines. Perhaps, those who doubt the effectiveness of vaccine or challenge the scientific evidence about climate change are skeptics who are doubting the very principles of scientific inquiry. Admittedly, this seems a far-fetched explanation. The challenge of skepticism has always been with us, and polarization seems instead a phenomenon more circumscribed and historically situated.  

Let us assume---perhaps somewhat optimistically---that people are often engaged in an empirically-informed rational inquiry and share a conception of what counts as evidence for a claim and criteria to assess the strength of this evidence. So long as this epistemological common ground exists and the inquirers share the same evidence, we should hope that no irredeemable disagreement can emerge. But a lot depends on what we mean by "sharing the same evidence". While two people might share the same "brute" evidence---say, they have access to the same data, documents, readings, etc.---they might interpret it differently. Or the same evidence might be ambiguous and thus invite different interpretations. 

Even people who share the same evidence and share the same standards for assessing the evidence might end up endorsing radically different positions---a phenomenon that has been called "rational polarization". How widespread or worried we should be about this phenomenon is another matter. Is rational polarization the most plausible explanation for widespread polarization? This is hard to say, but there is some empirical evidence that rational polarization plays an important role in explaining actual belief polarization.

**First essay due**


**Bubbles and Chambers**

Another explanation for belief polarization is that---because of the structure of information cascading on social media---people will have selective access to information and inhabit epistemic bubbles and echo chambers (though we will see these the two are different). Echo chambers and bubbles are failures of common ground---not in the sense that people do not share the principles of logic or reasoning---but in the sense that people do not share the same evidence. Given these circumstances, then, belief polarization is quite inevitable, and in many ways, entirely unsurprising. The cure, then, is simple: escape your epistemic bubble and eco chamber; go talk to those with whom you disagree; etc. As we will see, though, it is much harder to escape an echo chamber than an epistemic bubble.

**Epistemic Injustice**

Epistemic bubbles and echo chambers are ecosystem of information, with their own interval rules and regulations. They constitute, in some sense, ca ommon ground, at least for those who are part of them. A common ground, then, can also exclude, and perhaps it needs to exclude in order to include. So what happens when some people---along with their knowledge, evidence, testimony, experience---are excluded? Recently, a number of philosophers within the analytic tradition have theorized about what can be broadly called "epistemic injustice", which takes various forms: testimonial, hermeneutical, oppressive, racial ignorance. Before that, one of the foundational text of post-colonial theory took up the question that certain voices are excluded from the conversation---and cannot even articulate their position. We will read texts in both traditions.

## Wk 11 - 3/23


**Overlapping Consensus**

We now turn from epistemology to the political. It is political discussions that are often polarized. Here, disagreements are not only about matters of facts, but also about matters of value (though the line between facts and values might be fuzzy). Citizens in liberal democracies often hold radically different views about the good life, religion, education, the common good. A question that has shaped political philosophy in the analytic tradition over the last three decades is, how can political deliberations and judicial decisions be carried out---and be legitimate---despite the fact of radical disagreement about matters of values among the citizenry? One answer is that, in the end, reasonable people will share a political common ground, an "an overlapping consensus", which makes possible the exercise of public reason and its legitimacy. 

On this view, an important qualification must be made, however. That is, an overlapping consensus must be sought between reasonable people. Those who can be termed "unreasonable" do not enter the overlapping consensus, and thus are not entitled to pursue objections that may threaten the integrity and legitimacy of public reason.

<!---Earlier we discussed the topic of incommensurability from the point of view of language and conceptual schemes. Is there such a thing as value incommesurability? If so, can it be the explanation for the deep disagreements and ideological polarization that plague our political discourse today? As a preliminary step towards addressing this question, it is instructive to acquire a firm grasp of value incommensurability, its nature and scope.

**Second essay due**


**Self-organization**

The idea of an overlapping consensus presupposes that there is a minimal, essential set of values that we share (or procedures that we endorse), despite deep, widespread disagreement on many issues. But one wonders whether this overlapping consensus exists, and even if it does, one wonder whether it can ever be enough to give legitimacy to political deliberations. Another model suggests we need not worry about whether we have an overlapping consensus. A convergence might emerge, not as a matter of a theoretical commitment to a set of shared values, but as an self-organizing, natural order of social behaviors and practices.

## Wk 13 - 4/6


**Individualism and conflict**

The ideal of an overlapping consensus (as well as the idea of a self-organizing convergence) must confront the reality of increasing conflicts, division, partisanship in our political lives. Perhaps, deep structural reasons are the cause that cannot be overcome by invoking the need for a common ground. A couple of hypothesis are 
worth exploring. First, an individualistic, competition-driven market logic that extents everywhere end up pitting people against one another.  Second, political deliberations are inherently conflictual: friendship can exist only against the background of enmity.

**Trust and Civility**

Besides the more radical critiques, if we still think that the ideal of an overlapping consensus and public reason are good ones---we might not---the question is how to regain a functioning public reasoning via surgical interventions. One proposal focuses on reestablishing trust, between people of opposing views and between citizens and public institutions. Another proposal emphasize the virtue of civility. Both proposals suggest
that it attitudes toward another---not an agreement about content---are essential for a functioning public reason.

# Title IX 

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs. 

 

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.
